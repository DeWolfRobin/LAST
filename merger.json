These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic flaws, including:\n\n  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.\n\n  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.\n\nAn attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and clients.\n\nAlthough SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that these protocols be disabled entirely.\n\nNIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1, any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong cryptography'.", "MS06-035: Vulnerability in Server Service Could Allow Remote Code Execution (917159) (uncredentialed check)": "The remote host is vulnerable to heap overflow in the 'Server' service that may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the remote host with 'SYSTEM' privileges.\n\nIn addition to this, the remote host is also affected by an information disclosure vulnerability in SMB that may allow an attacker to obtain portions of the memory of the remote host.", "SNMP Agent Default Community Name (public)": "It is possible to obtain the default community name of the remote SNMP server.\n\nAn attacker may use this information to gain more knowledge about the remote host, or to change the configuration of the remote system (if the default community allows such modifications)."}, "Nessus-Severity-4": {"Microsoft IIS 6.0 Unsupported Version Detection": "According to its self-reported version number, the installation of Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0 on the remote host is no longer supported.\n\nLack of support implies that no new security patches for the product will be released by the vendor.

This situation can occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be broken, as stated below :\n\n  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the     server might not be descended from a known public     certificate authority. This can occur either when the     top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed     certificate, or when intermediate certificates are     missing that would connect the top of the certificate     chain to a known public certificate authority.\n\n  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate     that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.\n\n  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be     verified are the result of the certificate's issuer     using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not     support or does not recognize.\n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

Therefore, it is recommended that these protocols be disabled entirely.\n\nNIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure communications.

The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.\nMitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.\n\nAs long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.\n\nThe TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism.

This can occur either when the     top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed     certificate, or when intermediate certificates are     missing that would connect the top of the certificate     chain to a known public certificate authority.\n\n  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate     that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.\n\n  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be     verified are the result of the certificate's issuer     using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not     support or does not recognize.\n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

A man-in-the-middle attacker who is able to able to intercept the traffic between a client and a server hosting a SAM database can exploit this flaw to force a downgrade of the authentication level, which allows the execution of arbitrary Samba network calls in the context of the intercepted user, such as viewing or modifying sensitive security data in the Active Directory (AD) database or disabling critical services."}, "Nessus-Severity-3": {"MySQL Default Account Credentials": "The MySQL database server listening on the remote host has one or more known credentials.\n\nNote that this plugin checks generically for a variety of known account credentials.

Therefore, it is recommended that these protocols be disabled entirely.\n\nNIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure communications.
