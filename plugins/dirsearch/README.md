About wordlists
---------------
Dictionaries must be text files. Each line will be processed as such, except that the special word %EXT% is used, which will generate one entry for each extension (-e | --extension) passed as an argument.

Example:
- example/
- example.%EXT%

Passing the extensions "asp" and "aspx" will generate the following dictionary:
- example/
- example.asp
- example.aspx

You can also use -f | --force-extensions switch to append extensions to every word in the wordlists (like DirBuster).
